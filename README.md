# EGG-Binaryclassification
Analyzed EEG resting state-closed eyes recordings from 88 subjects, encompassing Alzheimer's disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and healthy controls (CN). Explored the subjects' brain waves in the frequency domain using the Welch method.

Constructed a binary classification model, designating AD as 1 and grouping FTD and CN as 0. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.928.
